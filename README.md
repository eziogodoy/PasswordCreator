## What is about and How was made..

This project is based on the development of a "Password Creator" which was made based on JS/HTML/CSS
The HTML work fulfills very little field of the product in general, on the other hand CSS occupies little field too, since everything is based on JS.

## Guide of use..

When loading the page, you should only use the red button in the middle of the screen ("Generate Password"). In this way, the machine will be in charge of asking the user several questions about how he would like his password, after having all the necessary Data, the machine will generate his password.
